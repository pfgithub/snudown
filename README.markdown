# Snudown

`Snudown` is a reddit-specific fork of the [Sundown](http://github.com/vmg/sundown)
Markdown parser used by GitHub, with Python integration added.

## Install

Run `setup.py install` to install the module.

## Setup for development on Mac OS X

For Mac OS X:

1. Install `afl-fuzz` via homebrew: `brew install afl-fuzz`
2. You can now install the module via `python setup.py install`
3. You may also compile snudown using the Makefile directly if you so wish

## Thanks

Many thanks to @vmg for implementing the initial version of this fork!
